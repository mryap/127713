Using checkpoint with knitr and RStudio

```{r}
library("formatR")
library("htmltools")
library("caTools")
library("bitops")
library("base64enc")
library("rprojroot")
library("rmarkdown")
library("evaluate")
library("stringi")
```


```{r}
library(checkpoint)
checkpoint
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
